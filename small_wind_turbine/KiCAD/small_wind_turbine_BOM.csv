This sheet is the BOM for the small wind turbine battery charger PCB. I have specced components for ~2A maximum current draw into a 12V marine battery. All of these components can be found on Digikey unless otherwise noted. Quantity is required for making one PCB; it is the actual components listed in the schematic. We may want to order enough for 2 PCB's.,,,,,,,,,
