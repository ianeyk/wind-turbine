    "# Battery Internal Resistance\n",
    "**Author:** Ian Eykamp, **Date:** June 20, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "To calculate the internal resistance of the 12V marine batteries in our posession in the lab. The link to purchase them is [here](https://www.westmarine.com/west-marine-group-24-dual-purpose-agm-battery-79-amp-hours-15020233.html), and I have not found the datasheet for the batteries yet, with a curve of voltage vs. state of charge (SOC).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "A battery's internal resistance manifests as a small resistance in series with the load. When we measure the battery terminals without anything between them (unloaded case), we get the true voltage of the battery. When we add a load resistor between the terminals, we get a voltage divider consisting of the load resistor and the internal resistance. The voltage across the load resistor $R_2$ is given by $V_{loaded} = V_{unloaded} \\cdot \\frac{R_2}{(R_{internal} + R_2)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the internal resistance can be calculated by $(R_{internal} + R_2) = \\frac{V_{unloaded}}{V_{loaded}} \\cdot R_2$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{internal} = \\frac{V_{unloaded}}{V_{loaded}} \\cdot R_2 - R_2 = (\\frac{V_{unloaded}}{V_{loaded}} - 1) \\cdot R_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I connected a 100Ω and a 6.8Ω 5W resistor across the terminals of all three batteries that we have in the lab. The internal resistances for each test are shown below."
